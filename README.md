### OpenTube
OpenTube is a project to make a open source, and modular video streaming service.
---
How it works:

# Server
Hosts videos, and tells registries what channels and videos they have.

# Registry
Keeps track of channels, acting like a phone book for Servers.

# Client
Does the fun part! Shows the video to you, first by contacting a registry, finding a channel it wants, then talking to a server to stream a video!

# Info

**All work is done in the dev branch, and once proven stable, is moved to master.**
