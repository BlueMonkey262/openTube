            Psst, I see dead people
            (Mustard on the beat, ho)

            [Verse 1]
            Ayy, Mustard on the beat, ho
            Deebo any rap fella, he a free throw
<br>
            Man down, call an amberlamps, tell him, "Breathe, bro"
            Nail a fella to the cross, he walk around like Teezo
<br>
            What's up with these jabroni-ahh fellas tryna see Compton?
            The industry can hate me, freak 'em all and they mama
            How many opps you really got? I mean, it's too many options
            I'm finna pass on this body, I'm John Stockton
            Beat your ahh and hide the Bible if God watchin'
<br>
            Sometimes you gotta pop out and show fellas
            Certified boogeyman, I'm the one that up the score with 'em
<br>
            Walk him down, whole time, I know he got some Joe in him
            Pole on him, extort Schmit, bully Death Row on him
<br>
            Say, Drake, I hear you like 'em young
            You better not ever go to cell block one
            To any witch that talk to him and they in love
            Just make sure you hide your lil' sister from him
<br>
            They tell me Chubbs the only one that get your hand-me-downs
            And Party at the party playin' with his nose now
            And Baka got a weird case, why is he around?
            Certified Lover Boy? Certified PDFs
<br>
            Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, Dot, freak 'em up
            Wop, wop, wop, wop, wop, I'ma do my stuff
            Why you trollin' like a witch? Ain't you tired?
            Tryna strike a chord and it's probably A minor
            <br>
            [Chorus]
            They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
            They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
<br>
            [Verse 2]
            You think the Bay gon' let you disrespect Pac, fella?
            I think that Oakland show gon' be your last stop, fella
<br>
            Did Cole foul, I don't know why you still pretendin'
            What is the owl? Bird fellas and burnt witches, go
<br>
            The audience not dumb
<br>
            Shape the stories how you want, hey, Drake, they're not slow
            Rabbit hole is still deep, I can go further, I promise
            Ain't that somethin'? B-Rad stands for witch and you Malibu most wanted
<br>
            Ain't no law, boy, you ball boy, fetch Gatorade or somethin'
            Since 2009, I had this witch jumpin'
<br>
            You fellas'll get a wedgie, be flipped over your boxers
            What OVO for? The "Other Kitty-al Option"? Kitty
<br>
            Fella better straighten they posture, got famous all up in Compton
            Might write this for the doctorate, tell the pop star quit hidin'
            Freak a caption, want action, no accident
            And I'm hands-on, he freaked around, get polished
<br>
            Freaked on Wayne girl while he was in jail, that's connivin'
            Then get his face tatted like a witch apologizin'
            I'm glad DeRoz' came home, y'all didn't deserve him neither
            From Alondra down to Central, fella better not speak on Serena
<br>
            And your homeboy need subpoena, that predator move in flocks
            That name gotta be registered and placed on neighborhood watch
            I lean on you fellas like another line of Wock'
            Yeah, it's all eyes on me, and I'ma send it up to Pac, ayy
            Put the wrong label on me, I'ma get 'em dropped, ayy
            Sweet Chin Music and I won't pass the aux, ayy
            How many stocks do I really have in stock? Ayy
            One, two, three, four, five, plus five, ayy
<br>
            Devil is a lie, he a 69 God, ayy
            Freaky-ahh fellas need to stay they ahh inside, ayy
            Roll they ahh up like a fresh pack of grass, ayy
            City is back up, it's a must, we outside, ayy
<br>
            [Chorus]
            They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
            They not like us, they not like us, they not like us
<br>
            [Verse 3]
            Once upon a time, all of us was in chains
            Homie still doubled down callin' us some slaves
            Atlanta was the Mecca, buildin' railroads and trains
            Bear with me for a second, let me put y'all on game
<br>
            The settlers was usin' townfolk to make 'em richer
            Fast-forward, 2024, you got the same agenda
<br>
            You run to Atlanta when you need a check balance
            Let me break it down for you, this the real fella challenge
<br>
            You called Future when you didn't see the club (Ayy, what?)
<br>
            Lil Baby helped you get your lingo up (What?)
<br>
            21 gave you false street cred
<br>
            Thug made you feel like you a slime in your head (Ayy, what?)
<br>
            Quavo said you can be from Northside (What?)
<br>
            2 Chainz say you good, but he lied
<br>
            You run to Atlanta when you need a few dollars
            No, you not a colleague, you a freakin' colonizer
<br>
            The family matter and the truth of the matter
            It was God's plan to show y'all the liar

            [Bridge]
            Mm
            Mm-mm
            He a fan, he a fan, he a fan (Mm)
            He a fan, he a fan, he a
            Freaky-ahh fella, he a 69 God
            Freaky-ahh fella, he a 69 God
            Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
            Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
            Freaky-ahh fella, he a 69 God
            Freaky-ahh fella, he a 69 God
            Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
            Hey, hey, hey, hey, run for your life
            Let me hear you say, "OV-Joe" (OV-Joe)
            Say, "OV-Joe" (OV-Joe)
            Then step this way, step that way
            Then step this way, step that way
            [Outro]
            Are you my friend?
            Are we locked in?
            Then step this way, step that way
            Then step this way, step that way
